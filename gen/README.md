# Generated clients

This directory contains REST and gRPC-Web clients generated from the EvergreenOS shared specifications. The checked-in
files act as placeholders to keep the repository functional in environments without access to the real specs. Run
`npm run generate:clients` after pulling the latest [`shared-specs`](https://github.com/evergreen-os/shared-specs) to
refresh these assets.
